2b-project is a project for medical professionals. A tool to unify the history of the patient for all disciplines, so the vision of professionals can be more holistic. The application has _two roles_, the administrator who can create professional accounts, and the professionals who can manage patients. Its development took less than one week, and was part of the second project of the Web Development Bootcamp at Ironhack.

The technologies used to develop it were: **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, **Express**, **MongoDB** and **Nodejs**.
